# Twitch Autoredeem

Automatically redeem the bonus channel points (the little black box that pops up occasionally) when they pop up in twitch chat. The chat doesn't need to be visible for this to work (the tab can be minimized or the video can be maximized).

You can tell it is working because it will say "STREAM CHAT (AUTO âœ…)" instead of just "STREAM CHAT" above the chat.
